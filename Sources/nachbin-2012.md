# Sec 1. Introduction

**Main goal:** To have a reliable one-dimensional reduced model that captures the main features of [wave_reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) and [wave_transmission](transmission_in_wave_dynamics) in domains akin to the Norwegian fjords. 

**Secondary goals:** 

- To better understand the dynamics of solitary waves ind domains similar to the Norwegian fjords.
- Better understanding of the [[compatibility_conditions]] at the branching points, when the dynamics are governed by a [boussinesq_type_systems_of_partial_differential_equations](boussinesq_type_systems_of_partial_differential_equations.md).
-  Understand how to deduce accurate reduced (one-dimensional) models for the [reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) and [transmission](transmission_in_wave_dynamics) of [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) on graphs/networks.


**Facts:**

- The [[jacobian_of_the_schwarz_christoffel_transformation]] we can rationalize the [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) characteristic at sharp-beds, both in narrow and wide channel configurations. 

# Sec 2.  Background on the Water Wave  Model

[[nachbin_2012_sec_2]] 

The goal of this section is to provide background information on the water wave model that will be used for the study. The section describes the mathematical formulation of the model specifically the governing equations and boundary conditions. It also provides details on the [boussinesq_type_system](boussinesq_type_systems_of_partial_differential_equations.md), which is a reduced potential used in the weakly nonlinear, weakly dispersive formulation for surface waves. The section further discusses numerical investigations that have been done on the system, including experiments for both sharp-corned and smooth, but significantly bent channels. Additionally, the section highlights some of the key findings from these investigations, such as the [reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) and [transmission](transmission_in_wave_dynamics) in [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) going through these bends being mostly controlled by the radio of the channel width to the wavelength.
