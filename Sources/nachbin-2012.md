# Sec 1. Introduction

The problem of studying the dynamics of [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) in complex domains such as open channels with sharp bends and branching points is of great interest due to its wide range of applications, including flood and tidal waves in rivers, channels of an irrigation network, and even [tsunamis_in_norwegian_fjords](tsunamis_in_norwegian_fjords.md). The paper aims to address this problem by investigating how nonlinear waves, such as [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md), propagate through sharp bends and branching points in open channels.


**Facts:**

- With the [[jacobian_of_the_schwarz_christoffel_transformation]] we can rationalize the [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) characteristic at sharp-beds, both in narrow and wide channel configurations. 

# Sec 2.  Background on the Water Wave  Model

- Provides the background material necessary for understanding the water wave problem and the boundary conditions that must be satisfied.

In this section of the paper, the background material on the corresponding water wave problem is explained. The problem is governed by the three-dimensional [euler_equation](euler_equation.md)  in the regime where the  [invisid_fluid](invisid_fluid.md) flow is considered to be incompressible and irrotational. The Euler equations are formulated in the presence of free surface boundary conditions, and both the [kinematic_condition](kinematic_condition.md) and a [bernoulli_law](bernoulli_law.md) are imposed along this free boundary. Under the assumption that the flow is considered to be incompressible and irrotational, a harmonic velocity potential is defined through which the velocity field can be obtained.

# Sec 4. Numerical Methods and Simulations

- Presents the results of the numerical simulations of various channel configurations.
