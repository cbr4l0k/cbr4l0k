# Sec 1. Introduction

**Main goal:** To have a reliable one-dimensional reduced model that captures the main features of [wave_reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) and [wave_transmission](transmission_in_wave_dynamics) in domains akin to the Norwegian fjords. 

**Secondary goals:** 

- To better understand the dynamics of solitary waves ind domains similar to the Norwegian fjords.
- Better understanding of the [[compatibility_conditions]] at the branching points, when the dynamics are governed by a [boussinesq_type_systems_of_partial_differential_equations](boussinesq_type_systems_of_partial_differential_equations.md).
-  Understand how to deduce accurate reduced (one-dimensional) models for the [reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) and [transmission](transmission_in_wave_dynamics) of [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) on graphs/networks.


**Facts:**

- The [[jacobian_of_the_schwarz_christoffel_transformation]] we can rationalize the [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md) characteristic at sharp-beds, both in narrow and wide channel configurations.
