The 5-point Laplacian is a mathematical formula used to approximate the second derivative of a function at a point. It helps us understand how the function's curvature changes at that point.

Imagine you have a function that describes the shape of a curve. The 5-point Laplacian looks at the function values at five nearby points: above, below, to the left, to the right, and at the center point. It calculates the second derivative by considering the differences between these function values.

To compute the 5-point Laplacian, you subtract the values of the function at the left and right points from twice the value at the center point. Then you add the values at the points above and below. Finally, you divide the sum by the square of the distance between the points.
