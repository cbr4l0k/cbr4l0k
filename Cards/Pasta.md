# Pasta

[Pasta](Pasta.md) is such a versatile dish, that composing a description distant from an estructural one, is really hard. Similar to [[Bread]], three distinct ingredients are the pillars of countless culinary creations; however, distinctive from [Bread](Bread.md), [Pasta](Pasta.md) is less time consuming. Being able to use this three ingredients in different proportions or even with alternative to the ingredients, opens  a door for an endless repertory of dishes.

The four core components for pasta making are:
1. [Flour](Flour%20in%20Pasta.md)
2. [[Egg]]
3. [[Water]]

## Chemistry Behind  

When starting the [[Hydrolysis]] process, the proteins in the [Wheat](Wheat.md) make use of the water, to create [Gluten](Gluten.md). The best way to develop healthy [Gluten](Gluten.md) bonds is to mix the flour with the water, extensively knead it and let the doe rest for at least 30 minutes.

Ensuring this process makes an elastic doe for the pasta.

## Cooking
