Imagine you're playing with water in a bathtub. When you make big waves by splashing the water with your hands, you create a lot of energy that makes the water move up and down for a while. This energy can travel across the surface of the water like a big bump, and it's called a [wave](water_waves).

Now, imagine that instead of splashing the water, you gently push the water back and forth in a special way that creates a very specific type of wave called a [solitary_waves](solitary_waves.md). 

Think of reduced potential as a kind of score that helps scientists figure out how strong the [solitary_wave](solitary_waves.md) is and how fast it's going. The higher the score, the stronger the wave. The reduced potential is a way for scientists to measure how much energy the wave has and how it moves through the water.

The reduced potential defined by Wu in [nachbin_2012](nachbin_2012.md) 

$$\phi(x,y,t)=\frac{1}{h_o+\eta}\int_{-h_0}^\eta \Phi(x,y,z,t)\ dz$$


Is used in the [weakly_nonlinear](weakly_nonlinear_formulations.md) and [weakly_dispersive_formulation](weakly_dispersive_formulations.md) for surface wave.
