The Bernoulli law is like a magic trick that air and water do. Imagine you are blowing air on a piece of paper. The paper moves because the air pushing it. The Bernoulli law says that when air or water is moving really fast, it can make things move too. This happens because the fast-moving air or water has less pressure than the slow moving air or water. So, when the fast-moving air or water goes past something, it makes the thing move, almost like it's being sucked or pushed. This trick is used to make airplanes fly and to move water through pipes.

The Bernoulli law is a fundamental principle in [[fluid_mechanics]] that relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid in motion. In the context of water wave problem discussed in [nachbin_2012](nachbin_2012.md), the Bernoulli law is one of the [free_surface_boundary_conditions](free_surface_boundary_conditions.md) that must be satisfied. It relates the pressure and the velocity of the fluid at the [free_surface](free_surface.md) to the elevation of the surface. Specifically, the Bernoulli law states that the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy and potential energy per unit volume of the fluid is constant along a streamline.
