The Bernoulli law is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid in motion. In the context of water wave problem discussed in [nachbin-2012](nachbin-2012.md), the Bernoulli law is one of the free surface boundary conditions that must be satisfied. It relates the pressure and the velocity of the fluid at the free surface to the elevation of the surface. Specifically, the Bernoulli law states that the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy and potential energy per unit volume of the fluid is constant along a streamline.
