The Bernoulli law is a fundamental principle in [[fluid_mechanics]] that relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid in motion. In the context of water wave problem discussed in [nachbin-2012](nachbin-2012.md), the Bernoulli law is one of the [free_surface_boundary_conditions](free_surface_boundary_conditions.md) that must be satisfied. It relates the pressure and the velocity of the fluid at the [free_surface](free_surface.md) to the elevation of the surface. Specifically, the Bernoulli law states that the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy and potential energy per unit volume of the fluid is constant along a streamline.
