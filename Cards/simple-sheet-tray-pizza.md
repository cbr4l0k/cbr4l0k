4. Sweat the garlic paste and the diced onion.
5. Add oregano and red chilly flakes (to taste).
6. Add salt and pepper (to taste).
7. Add a hole can of pealed tomatoes, and wait until soft and semi-dissolved. 
8. At this point, blend the concoction until it turns into the desired texture.
9. Add red wine vinagre (TODO: Try if it works with red wine) (to taste).
10. Add more salt, pepper, or red chilly flakes if missing.
11. Let it all reduce for 5 to 8 minutes.

**dough**

1. In a big bowl, mix 5 grams of active dry yeast with 425 grams of warm water for about 5 minutes.
2. Add 133 grams of olive oil and 15 grams of honey to the bowl, and mix.
3. Add 565 grams of flour and 140 grams of corn meal.
4. Mix all the ingredients until the dough comes together (*don't over mix it*)
5. In a big container add olive oil.
6. Throw the dough on the container and fold into itself 
7. Let it rest.

**tips**

1. Mix salt and corn meal, and add the mixture to the pan (before the dough), so the dough does not stick to the pan.
2. The dough must rest at least 14 hours before being cooked.
