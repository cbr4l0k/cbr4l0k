An inviscid fluid is a type of fluid that doesn't have any internal friction or resistance to flow. It's like a rally slippery liquid that flows effortlessly without any obstacles or bumps along the way.

In real life, all fluids have some degree of viscosity or  stickiness, which means that they experience internal friction and resistance to flow. But in some cases, it's useful to study the behavior of fluids assuming that they are inviscid, because it makes the math simpler and easier to work with.
