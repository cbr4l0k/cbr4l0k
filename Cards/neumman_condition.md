The Neumann condition is a rule that tell us how to deal with the behavior of a function at the boundary of a region. Imagine you have a big swimming pool with a fence around it. You want to know what happens to the water at the edge of the pool.

The Neumann condition says that the rate of change of the function (like the water level) at the boundary is equal to a certain value. Specifically, the Neumann condition tells us that the derivative of the function with respect to the normal direction (the direction perpendicular to the boundary) is equal to a given value.

> The value in the boundary changes for each function.
