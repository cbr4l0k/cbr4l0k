[Solitary Waves](solitary_waves.md) require a balance between these two factores. Specifically, the [nonlinearity](nonlinearity_in_solitary_waves.md) of the wave must be stron enoughtto counteract the [dispersion](dispersion.md) caused by the medium. This allows the wave to maintain its shape and speed over long distances without losing energy or becoming distorted. The balance between [nonlinearity](nonlinearity_in_solitary_waves.md) and [dispersion](dispersion.md) is a delicate one and can depend on the specific properties of the medium and the wave itself.
