A conformal map is a special kind of map that keeps angles the same. Imagine you have a big rubber sheet with a shape drawn on it. Now you want to stretch or shrink the sheet so that the shape becomes a different shape. 

But if you just pull on the sheet randomly, you might change the angles of the shape and make it look weird. A conformal map, on the other hand is like stretching or shrinking the sheet in a very specific way so that the angles of the shape stay the same.
