# Flour in Pasta
Flour is created by milling the [[Wheat]] , rendering the grain into a digestible substance. Leaving mainly the endosperm, and removing most of the bran and germ from the grain. 
Endosperm
In pasta making there exist tow main paths for the flour selection:

1. [[Zero Zero Flour]]
2. [[Semolina Flour]]

Using the first kind returns a softer and bouncier pasta, and using the second one makes pasta with more texture and with a harder bite.

While [Zero Zero Flour](Zero%20Zero%20Flour) comes from a softer kind of flour, [Semolina Flour](Semolina%20Flour) comes from [[Durum Wheat]].
