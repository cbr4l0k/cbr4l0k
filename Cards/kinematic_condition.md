The kinematic condition is one of the [free_surface_boundary_conditions](free_surface_boundary_conditions.md) that must be satisfied in the water wave problem. It relates the elevation of the [free_surface](free_surface.md) to the velocity potential of the fluid. Specifically, the kinematic condition states that the normal component of the velocity of the fluid  at the [free_surface](free_surface.md)  is equal to the time derivative of the elevation of the surface. This condition is derived from the assumption that the [free_surface](free_surface.md) is a material surface that moves with the fluid particles.
