The kinematic condition is one of the [free_surface_boundary_conditions](free_surface_boundary_conditions) that must be satisfied in the water wave problem. It relates the elevation of the free surface to the velocity potential of the fluid. Specifically, the kinematic condition states that the normal component of the velocity of the fluid  at the [free_surface](free_surface)  is equal to the time derivative of the elevation of the surface. This condition is derived from the assumption that the [free_surface](free_surface) is a material surface that moves with the fluid particles.
