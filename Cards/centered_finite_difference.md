The centered finite difference is a numerical approximation technique used to estimate the derivative of a function at a specific point.

Imagine you have a function that describes how one quantity changes with respect to another, and you want to find the rate of change (derivative) of that function at a particular point. The centered finite difference provides an estimate of this derivative by considering the function values at neighboring points.

To compute the centered finite difference, you take two points on either side of the point where you want to estimate the derivative. Let's call these points x - h and x + h, where x is the point of interest and h is a small step size.

The centered finite difference formula is given by:

$$f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}$$
