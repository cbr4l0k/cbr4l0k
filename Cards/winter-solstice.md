# Winter Solstice

Winter solstice symbolizes the initiation in the search for a higher self.  It reminds me to the [[The Hero's Journey]]. It's similar because in both of this quests are defined by a stage where the neophyte/hero must face all its flaws, then die, and finally through a revelation, being re-birth into a higher being. In other hand, [The Hero's Journey](The%20Hero's%20Journey.md)  is filled with multiple helpers and mentors, while the initiation symbolized by the winter solstice is meant to be done by the neophyte alone; however, in the initiation the idea of self is projected in all creation, implying that the expedition is not fulfilled alone, because [[Being Alone is Being With Everything]].

>  because every day is a new occasion, a new door, a new opportunity. Do not waste the days of your lives, because the time will come, fatally will come, when it will be your turn, your turn to undertake this most sublime of adventures. Glorious beyond words will be the reward if it succeeds. Therefore practice, constantly practice your will. Open your hearts more and more. Remember the divinity within you, the innermost divinity in you, the heart of you, the essence of you. Love others, for the others are yourselves. Forgive them, for in forgiving them you are forgiving yourself. Help them, for in doing so you will be preparing your own feet to descend into the Pit, for in hating them, you are hating yourself. Turn your backs to the Pit and turn your faces towards the Sun!

The awakening of  different sun deities is related to the winter solstice, because from that day forward (until [Summer Solstice](Summer%20Solstice.md)) the sun sets later in the day. In [[Japanese Mythology]],  [winter-solstice](winter-solstice.md) is seen in [[Amaterasu]]'s myth, the moment she emerges from her cave.
