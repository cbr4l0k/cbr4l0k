The Riemman mapping theorem states that any simply connected region in the complex pane (a region with no holes) can be conformally mapped to the unit disk (the dis centered at the origin with radius 1) via a unique [[conformal_map]]. This mean that there exists a one-to-one and onto map between the region and the unit disk that preserves angles and orientation.

> Imagine you have a piece of paper with a shape drawn on it. Maybe it's a square or a star or a blob. The Riemman mapping theorem says that you can transform this shape into another shape, like a circle or a square, by stretching and bending the paper, but you can't tear it or poke holes in it.

> This transformation is really special because it keeps all the angles and distances between points the same. This means that if two points on the original shape were really close, they'll still be really close together after the transformation. And if two lines were perpendicular before the transformation, they'll still be perpendicular after the transformation.
