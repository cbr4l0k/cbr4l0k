The Jacobian  works by telling you how much a function/mapping changes in different directions. 

> In the case of the [schwarz_christoffel_transformation](schwarz_christoffel_transformation.md), it's like a map that shows you how to move around the shape without messing it up. With the Jacobian, you can be confident that you're transforming the shape correctly and keeping it looking good.
