It makes reference to the ratio between the width of an open channel (e.i. a river or a canal) and the [[wavelenght]] of the [solitary_wave](solitary_waves.md) propagating through it. 

This ratio is relevant because it affects the behavior of the wave as it propagates through the channel.

As the [channel_width_to_wavelenght_ratio](channel_width_to_wavelenght_ratio.md) ratio increases, the amount of [reflection](reflection_in_wave_dynamics.md) of the wave increases, which an lead to more complex wave dynamics.
