Imagine you are playing with a ball in the air. When you throw the ball, it moves because of the force you applied to it. The Euler equation is like a rule that helps us understand how things move in the air or in water, like waves. It tells us how fast and in what direction things will move when we push them. Scientists use the Euler equation to understand how air and water move and how waves are created.
