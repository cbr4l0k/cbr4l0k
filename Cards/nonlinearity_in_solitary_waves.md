Regarding [solitary waves](solitary_waves.md), "nonlinearity" is referring to the fact that the way the wave behaves, is not proportional to the amplitude of the wave. As the wave gets larger or smaller, its behavior does not change in a simple, linear way. 

> **Nonlinearity** can lead to complex interactions between waves and can cause waveforms to distort or break up over time.
