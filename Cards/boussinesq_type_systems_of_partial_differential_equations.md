Are a class of [[nonlinear_partial_differential_equations]] that arise in the study of fluid dynamics and related fields 

> Named after the French mathematician Joseph Boussinesq, who introduced the basic equations in the late 19th century.

Boussinesq-type systems typically describe the evolution of a  fluid under the influence of various forces, such as gravity, viscosity, and external or internal sources. They are characterized by a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the evolution of various quantities, such as velocity pressure, temperature, and density, in time and space.

The basic form of a Boussinesq-type system includes the [[navier_stokes_equation]] for fluid in motion, which are coupled with an energy equation or an equation for temperature or density. The resulting system is highly nonlinear and difficult to solve analytically.

Boussinesq-type systems have important applications in various fields, including oceanography, atmospheric sciences, geophysics, and engineering. They are  used, for example, to model the circulation of ocean currents, the behavior of atmospheric waves, an the dynamics of turbulent flows. They are also used in the design and analysis of hydraulic structures, such as dams, bridges, and pipelines.

	Imagine you have a glass of water that you're trying to study. You might want to know how fast the water is moving, how warm it is, and how the pressure changes as you move the glass. Boussinesq-type systems help scientists answer these questions by giving them a way to write down equations that describe all these things at once.
