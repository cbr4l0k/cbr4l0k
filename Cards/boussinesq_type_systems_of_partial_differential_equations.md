Are a class of [[nonlinear_partial_differential_equations]] that arise in the study of fluid dynamics and related fields 

> Named after the French mathematician Joseph Boussinesq, who introduced the basic equations in the late 19th century.

The Boussinesq system is a set of equations used to describe surface waves in fluid dynamics. It is a [weakly_nonlinear](weakly_nonlinear_formulations.md) and [weakly_dispersive_formulation](weakly_dispersive_formulations.md) that is derived from the Euler equations for incompressible and irrotational fluid flow with free surface boundary conditions.
