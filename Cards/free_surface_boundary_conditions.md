[free_surface_boundary_conditions](free_surface_boundary_conditions.md) refers to a rule that is applied to the surface of a fluid, such as water, when studying the behavior of [waves](water_waves). In the context of [nachbin_2012](nachbin_2012.md), the term "[free_surface](free_surface.md)" to the surface of the fluid that is not in contact  with any solid boundary, such as the walls of a container. 

The "boundary condition" refers to a set of rules or equations that are used to describe the behavior of the fluid at the surface, in [nachbin_2012](nachbin_2012.md) two of the boundary conditions are:

- [bernoulli_law](bernoulli_law.md)
- [kinematic_condition](kinematic_condition.md)
