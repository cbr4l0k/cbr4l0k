A [mathematical-model](mathematical-model.md) is a representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices, objects, or situations. This concept have a similarity to the [scientific-method](scientific-method), manly because both of this concepts consist of transitions between  a "real world" environment and a conceptual environment. While the [scientific-method](scientific-method) goal is to understand the concept, [mathematical-modeling](mathematical-model.md) tries to understand it and recreate it in mathematical terms.
