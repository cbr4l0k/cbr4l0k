Imagine  you are playing with a toy boat in a pool of water. When you make waves  by moving the boat, you notice that the waves are not all the same size and speed. Some waves are bigger and slower, while others are smaller and faster. This is because the waves in the water can be affected by things like gravity, the shape of the pool, and how much water is in the pool.

A weakly dispersive formulation is a way for scientists to understand and predict how waves in water behave when the differences in wave sizes and speeds  are not too big. It's like looking at the waves in the pool and noticing that, even though they are not all the same, they are still similar enough to follow a pattern that we can understand. Scientists use this formulation to help them predict and study waves in different bodies of water like the ocean or a river.
