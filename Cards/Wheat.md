# Wheat

## Structure 

The **Bran** is like the shield of the seed, is not easily digested so is not usually used for cooking.
The **Germ** is where the future of the plant is stored, or in more scientific terms, is the seed of the wheat, being the part that would sprout into a new plant.
And the [[Endosperm]] is the part of the wheat that contains both proteins needed to create [Gluten](Gluten.md): [[Gliadin]] and [[Glutenin]].
