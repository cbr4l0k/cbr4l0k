# The Four Seasons

![](Pasted%20image%2020221129235351.png)

Like the [[Major Arcana]] in [[Tarot]], the four seasons that define the span of a year symbolizes multiple steps of growth for a human being; but instead of having 22 steps, it only have 4, making each step more general. It's not like this four steps are an exact mirror of our reality, but they work as a moment for reflection, meditation and growth, both communal and individual.
